//* Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
var array = ["Fairy Meadows", "Nile", "Italy", "Saudi Arabia"];
for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    console.log(array[i]);
}
